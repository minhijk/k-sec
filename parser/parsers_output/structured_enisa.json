Criteria may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- business strategic objectives; \n- stakeholder expectations; \n- regulatory requirements; and \n- - rganizational culture. \n- Define the risk tolerance level, which refers to the level of risk that an entity is willing to accept in pursuit \n- f its long-term objectives. Examples may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- acceptable downtime for systems for which criticality is high (e.g. up to two hours of downtime \nper month); \n- tolerance for data loss (e.g. loss of data with low criticality within a 24-hour window); \n- maximum financial loss that can be absorbed without jeopardizing operations (e.g. up to EUR \n100,000 in recovery costs); There are many risk-management standards, frameworks and methodologies. A non-exhaustive list of them can be found in the ENISA publication \nCompendium of risk-managements frameworks with potential interoperability, \n- willingness to invest a certain percentage of revenue in measures (e.g. 5% of annual revenue); \n- adherence to regulatory obligations with specific penalties or fines influencing risk acceptance; \n- acceptable level of customer dissatisfaction or negative media exposure from a data breach (e.g. \ntolerating one major incident every few years); \n- acceptance of certain vulnerabilities based on risk mitigation measures in place (e.g. outdated \nsoftware provided that it is monitored and patched regularly); \n- time frame for responding to and recovering from incidents (e.g. a maximum of 48 hours for \ncontainment); and \n- acceptance of minor incidents as part of normal operations while prioritizing major threats. \n- Define risk acceptance criteria, which may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- accepting risks categorized as low severity, such as minor data leaks that don't expose sensitive \ninformation; \n- accepting risks assessed as having a low likelihood of occurrence (e.g. certain rare types of \ncyberattacks); \n- accepting risks if the cost of mitigation exceeds the potential impact (e.g. not upgrading legacy \nsystems if the upgrade cost is significantly higher than potential losses); \n- accepting specific compliance risks if there is a plan in place to address them within a defined \ntimeframe (e.g. temporarily accepting minor non-compliance with a commitment to remediate \nwithin six months); \n- allowing certain risks in low-criticality systems or departments that do not affect core business \n- perations (e.g. accepting a risk in a test environment); \n- accepting certain vulnerabilities for a defined period while planning for remediation (e.g. \naccepting the risk of outdated software for three months until a full upgrade can be completed); \n- accepting risks where the expected incident impact falls below a predetermined financial \nthreshold (e.g. losses under EUR 50,000 accepted without further action); \n- accepting risks after informing stakeholders and receiving their agreement, particularly if they \nunderstand the trade-offs involved; and \n- accepting residual risks where existing measures reduce the likelihood or impact to an acceptable \nlevel (e.g. using encryption for sensitive data but accepting risks of loss due to user error). \n- Define risk criteria, that is, how the entity evaluates the significance of the risks that it identifies and makes \ndecisions concerning risks. Risk criteria may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- alignment with risk appetite: accepting risks that align with the organization's overall risk appetite, \nsuch as delays in internal reporting processes that do not impact customer service or compliance; \n- regulatory and legal exposure: prioritizing risks based on potential legal or regulatory \nconsequences, such as treating violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \ninvolving customer data as high-risk due to potential fines and reputational damage; \n- reputational impact: escalating risks that could significantly harm the organization's public image, \nsuch as incidents likely to attract media attention; \n- risk velocity: giving higher priority to risks with high velocity, such as zero-day exploits that can \nbe weaponised before patches are available; More information on risk criteria can be found in ISO/IEC 27005:2022, paragraph 6.4. It is important to understand that risk appetite, defined as the \namount of risk an entity is willing to pursue or accept, can vary considerably from entity to entity. For instance, factors affecting an entity’s risk \nappetite include size, complexity and sector. \n- recovery complexity: treating risks as critical if they involve complex or time-consuming recovery, \nsuch as cyber-attacks on legacy systems with limited vendor support; \n- emerging technology risks: Considering risks involving emerging technologies as higher priority, \nsuch as AI systems producing unexplainable or non-compliant decisions due to lack of \ntransparency; \n- stakeholder sensitivity: re-evaluating risks that concern key stakeholders, such as risks flagged \nby the board, regulators or major customers, even if the assessed technical risk is low. \n- Criteria for performing cybersecurity risk assessments refer to consequences, likelihood or level of risk. \nThese may refer to (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- the importance of assets; \n- the severity of threats; \n- the vulnerability of network and information systems; \n- impact analysis; \n- existing measures; and \n- stakeholders concerns or requirements. \n- Make a list of the main risks for the security of network and information systems, taking into account the \nmain threats to the assets in scope. \n- Make sure that each risk is associated with at least one: \n- - f the risk treatment options or a combination of them, in line with the results of the risk \nassessment and in accordance with the entity’s policy on the security of network and information \nsystems (recital 11 of the regulation); and \n- specific risk treatment measure. \n- Develop risk-treatment plans to address the elements in points (i) and (j) in point 2.1.2 of the Annex to the \nregulation. \n- Assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals or teams for executing these risk treatment plans.",

Typically, they are measured in maximum time needed to \nrecover data without causing unacceptable, according to the risk assessment, damage to the \nentity’s activities, for example maximum recovery time for an e-commerce website, an ERP \nsystem or an email server. \n- Service delivery objective (SDO) to determine the minimum level of performance that needs to \nbe reached by business functions during the alternate processing mode. An indicative and nonexhaustive list of examples includes: \n \nthe percentage of inbound calls to be answered by a call centre within a specific \ntimeframe; \n \nthe level of availability of ordering and payment systems of an e-commerce website \nwithin a specific timeframe; \n \nthe restoration time for accessing essential shared folders via a cloud file access \nsystem; and \n \nthe timeframe within which the full functionality of the remote work infrastructure is \nrestored. \n- Maximum acceptable outage (MAO) or maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD) to \ndetermine the time it would take for the potential impacts of not providing a product/service or \nperforming an activity to become unacceptable or significant, in accordance with the risk \nassessment. Typically they are longer than RTOs. MAOs focus on service availability while RPOs \nfocus on data loss. An indicative and non-exhaustive list of examples: \n \nthe period of time beyond which the customer service would be severely impacted and \nreputation risk increases quickly; \n \nthe longest period of time that extended outage of an e-commerce website might result \nto major loss of sales and customer trust; \n \nthe longest period of time that shared access to project files may halt collaboration or \ndecision-making in case that data is stored in cloud; and \n \nthe maximum acceptable outage for remote work infrastructure beyond which business \nfunctions are significantly impaired and productivity losses begin to escalate. \n- RTOs, RPOs and SDOs may be used to determine backup and redundancy procedures. Consider the following standards: ISO/TS 22317:2021 and NIST special publication 800-34. For definitions of terms, refer to ISO 22300:2021. \n- Document disaster recovery plan, taking into account: \n- the RTOs, RPOs and SDOs; and \n- compliance with applicable regulations and legislation.",

Nonetheless, \nsome failures may require immediate patching depending on their criticality. \n- Prioritise and apply patches based on risk. Evaluate the severity of the vulnerability, exposure of the affected \nsystem and likelihood of exploitation. \n- Deploy vulnerability management technologies to identify unpatched and misconfigured software. \n- Define your relevant security information sources considering your assets and continuously monitor them for \npatch announcements, patch and non-patch remediation, and general threats. \n- Verify the patch sources through (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- digital certificates to verify the vendor; \n- digital signatures of the patches \n- change logs provided by the vendor; and \n- feedback from the community concerning the reliability of the vendor. \n- Consider a strategy for applying patches after approval or testing following the change management procedure \n(indicative, non exhaustive list): NIST SP 800-40 Rev. 4, ‘Guide to enterprise patch management planning: preventive maintenance for technology’, \n- Blue/green allows the patches to be applied first in an isolated environment identical to the \nproduction environment, and then in the production environment. This ensures zero downtime \nand an immediate rollback option. \n- Rolling deployment allows gradual updates of parts of the production environment, one set \n- f servers or instances at a time, rather than deploying a patch all at once. It is ideal for large and \ndistributed environments. \n- Feature toggles allow new features or patches to be deployed to production but keep them \ndisabled until they are ready to be used. They are suitable for control over new features or \npatches when they are turned on, making it easy to test and release. \n- Shadow deployment allows new code or patches to be deployed directly to production but it \nshadows live traffic by mirroring user requests to both the current and new systems to observe \nhow the new version behaves without affecting the user experience. It is ideal for testing new \nfeatures in production without affecting users. \n- Hotfix deployments are used for critical patches that need to be applied immediately to address \nsevere issues. \n- Where appropriate and to reduce risks related to significant updates in important dependencies, consider \nperforming a trial using release candidates ( 60) of these components, to get an early indication of \nincompatibilities or breaking changes, so they may be remedied. If any of these components are open \nsource software, offer feedback about any issues found during this trial.",

This should include results of \ntesting and any issues encountered and resolved. \n- Documentation of test plans and results for patches before deployment to production environments. \n- Documentation of change requests for deploying patches, including approvals and impact assessments. \n- Detailed audit trails showing the steps taken from patch identification to deployment. \n- Checks for the latest patches. \n- Approved documented actions for applying patches. \n- Records of changes logged, reviewed and approved. \n- Evidence of vendor verification mechanisms for example digital certificates and digital signatures. \n- Reports from internal and external audits evaluating the effectiveness of the patch management processes. ‘Canary deployment’ is an example of this and refers to a gradual rollout strategy for software updates or patches. To minimise the risk of the patch \nintroducing new problems, the entity might apply the patch to a small number (e.g. 5%) of servers or systems and then gradually apply it to the \nentire system. It is ideal for rolling out changes slowly and monitoring for problems without affecting many users.

In addition to those mentioned in the mapping table at the end of this section, consider the following: \n- NIST, ‘Guide to a Secure Enterprise Network Landscape’, NIST SP 800-215, \n- ISO/IEC 27033 series of standards on network security. \n- NIST SP 800-215 and 1800-35 propose a zero-trust model, which assumes that no part of the network is trusted. Different organisations use different terminology for the term ‘operational network’, for example ‘enterprise network’, ‘corporate network’, ‘IT \nnetwork’, ‘OT network’ and ‘administration network’. However, the fundamental concept remains focused on the interconnectedness and \nfunctionality of components working together towards common objectives set by the management of the entity. The network for administration of a network and information system, often referred to as network administration, involves managing, monitoring and \nmaintaining an entity’s network infrastructure to ensure its optimal performance and security. \nTECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION",

Technical method for segmentation should be considered, the usage of VLAN, physical separate switches or other methods should be defined. \nHowever physically separating subnets is not feasible in entirely software-defined environments (container clusters, cloud environments, etc.). A perimeter network, also known as a demilitarised zone (DMZ), is a subnetwork that separates an entity’s internal network from untrusted external \nnetworks, such as the internet. The primary purpose of a perimeter network is to add an extra layer of security by isolating external-facing services \nfrom the internal network. \nTECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION",

In a fully remote operating model where the organization does not maintain centralized office spaces or on-premises infrastructure, traditional \nperimeter and physical access control measures (e.g. badge systems, mantraps, on-site security personnel) may not be applicable. Instead, the \nfocus should shift to ensuring that access to corporate resources is governed through strong logical access controls, such as multi-factor \nauthentication (MFA), endpoint compliance checks and secure connectivity (e.g. VPN or Zero Trust Network Access). For personnel working from \nhome organizations should provide on securing home workspaces—such as restricting unauthorized physical access to work devices and \nusing locked rooms or cabinets when necessary. Where third-party cloud or co-location facilities are used, physical access controls should be \nreviewed and enforced contractually through SLAs and verified via audit reports (e.g. ISO 27001, SOC 2). \n- Based on the results of the risk assessment, determine high-criticality assets and the impact of their \nbeing compromised. This will help in identifying the perimeter for such assets. \n- Prevent unauthorised physical access to facilities and set up adequate measures. \n- Physical access control measures designed to protect the entity as a whole will also protect \nindividual assets. \n- Consider introducing further specific access control measures for specific assets or facilities. \n- Consider physical security measures (indicative, non-exhaustive list): \n- physical access controls such as key cards, biometric scanners, locks and security personnel to \nrestrict access to high-criticality areas, \n- electronic control of entry, with an audit trail, \n- segmentation of spaces or creation of zones according to authorization levels and their contents, \n- CCTV cameras and monitoring systems to continuously observe sensitive areas, \n- fencing, barriers and security patrols for securing physical perimeters, \n- guards and/or alarms to monitor every physical access point to the facility where the information \nsystem resides, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. \n- Develop and enforce procedures for granting, reviewing and revoking physical access rights \n(section 11.2). \n- Identify a designated official within the entity to review and approve the list of personnel with \nauthorized physical access. \n- Maintain a list of personnel with authorized access to facilities, and their authorization levels.",
        "evidence": "- Risk assessment results \n- Existence of physical security measures \n- Procedures for granting, reviewing and revoking physical access rights in accordance with point 11.2 in \nthe Annex to the regulation.",
