    "content_description": "Because images are effectively static archive files that include all the components used to run a given app, components within an image may be missing critical security updates or are otherwise outdated. An image created with fully up-to-date components may be free of known vulnerabilities for days or weeks after its creation, but at some time vulnerabilities will be discovered in one or more image components, and thus the image will no longer be up-to-date. Unlike traditional operational patterns in which deployed software is updated ‘in the field’ on the hosts it runs on, with containers these updates must be made upstream in the images themselves, which are then redeployed. Thus, a common risk in containerized environments is deployed containers having vulnerabilities because the version of the image used to generate the containers has vulnerabilities.",
    "content_remediation": "There is a need for container technology-specific vulnerability management tools and processes. Traditional vulnerability management tools make many assumptions about host durability and app update mechanisms and frequencies that are fundamentally misaligned with a containerized model. These tools are often unable to detect vulnerabilities within containers, leading to a false sense of safety. Organizations should use tools that take the pipeline-based build approach and immutable nature of containers and images into their design to provide more actionable and reliable results. Key aspects of effective tools and processes include: 1. Integration with the entire lifecycle of images, from the beginning of the build process, to whatever registries the organization is using, to runtime. 2. Visibility into vulnerabilities at all layers of the image, not just the base layer of the image but also application frameworks and custom software the organization is using. Visibility should be centralized across the organization and provide flexible reporting and monitoring views aligned with organizations’ business processes. 3. Policy-driven enforcement; organizations should be able to create “quality gates” at each stage of the build and deployment process to ensure that only images that meet the organization’s vulnerability and configuration policies are allowed to progress. For example, organizations should be able to configure a rule in the build process to prevent the progression of images that include vulnerabilities with Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [18] ratings above a selected threshold.",

For example, an image may not be configured with a specific user account to “run as” and thus run with greater privileges than needed. As another example, an image may include an SSH daemon, which exposes the container to unnecessary network risk. Much like in a traditional server or VM, where a poor configuration can still expose a fully up-to-date system to attack, so too can a poorly configured image increase risk even if all the included components are up-to-date.",

Ongoing, continuously updated, centralized reporting and monitoring of image compliance state to identify weaknesses and risks at the organizational level. 3. Enforcement of compliance requirements by optionally preventing the running of non- compliant images. 4.

Other examples of embedded secrets include connection strings, SSH private keys, and X.509 private keys. When an app is packaged into an image, these secrets can be embedded directly into the image file system. However, this practice creates a security risk because anyone with access to the image can easily parse it to learn these secrets.",
    "content_remediation": "Secrets should be stored outside of images and provided dynamically at runtime as needed. Most orchestrators, such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, include native management of secrets. These orchestrators not only provide secure storage of secrets and ‘just in time’ injection to containers, but also make it much simpler to integrate secret management into the build and deployment processes. For example, an organization could use these tools to securely provision the database connection string into a web application container. The orchestrator can ensure that only the web application container had access to this secret, that it is not persisted to disk, and that anytime the web app is deployed, the secret is provisioned into it. Organizations may also integrate their container deployments with existing enterprise secret management systems that are already in use for storing secrets in non-container environments. These tools typically provide APIs to retrieve secrets securely as containers are deployed, which eliminates the need to persist them within images. Regardless of the tool chosen, organizations should ensure that secrets are only provided to the specific containers that require them, based on a pre-defined and administrator-controlled setting, and that secrets are always encrypted at rest and in transit using Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 approved cryptographic algorithms5 contained in validated cryptographic modules.",

While these vulnerable images do not directly pose a threat simply by being stored in the registry, they increase the likelihood of accidental deployment of a known-vulnerable version.",
    "content_remediation": "The risk of using stale images can be mitigated through two primary methods. First, organizations can prune registries of unsafe, vulnerable images that should no longer be used. This process can be automated based on time triggers and labels associated with images. Second, operational practices should emphasize accessing images using immutable names that specify discrete versions of images to be used. For example, rather than configuring a deployment job to use the image called my-app, configure it to deploy specific versions of the image, such as my-app:2.3 and my-app:2.4 to ensure that specific, known good instances of images are deployed as part of each job. Another option is using a “latest” tag for images and referencing this tag in deployment automation. However, because this tag is only a label attached to the image and not a guarantee of freshness, organizations should be cautious to not overly trust it. Regardless of whether an organization chooses to use discrete names or to use a “latest” tag, it is critical that processes be put in place to ensure that either the automation is using the most recent unique name or the images tagged “latest” actually do represent the most up-to-date versions.",

This can lead to weaker account management practices and ‘orphaned’ accounts in the orchestrator because these systems are less rigorously managed. Because many of these accounts are highly privileged within the orchestrator, compromise of them can lead to systemwide compromise. Containers typically use data storage volumes that are managed by the orchestration tool and are not host specific. Because a container may run on any given node within a cluster, the data required by the app within the container must be available to the container regardless of which host it is running on. At the same time, many organizations manage data that must be encrypted at rest to prevent unauthorized access.",
    "content_remediation": "Access to cluster-wide administrative accounts should be tightly controlled as these accounts provide ability to affect all resources in the environment. Organizations should use strong authentication methods, such as requiring multifactor authentication instead of just a password. Organizations should implement single sign-on to existing directory systems where applicable. Single sign-on simplifies the orchestrator authentication experience, makes it easier for users to use strong authentication credentials, and centralizes auditing of access, making anomaly detection more effective. Traditional approaches for data at rest encryption often involve the use of host-based capabilities that may be incompatible with containers. Thus, organizations should use tools for encrypting data used with containers that allow the data to be accessed properly from containers regardless of the node they are running on. Such encryption tools should provide the same barriers to unauthorized access and tampering, using the same cryptographic approaches as those defined in NIST SP 800-111 [19].",

    "content_description": "In most containerized environments, traffic between individual nodes is routed over a virtual overlay network. This overlay network is typically managed by the orchestrator and is often opaque to existing network security and management tools. For example, instead of seeing database queries being sent from a web server container to a database container on another host, traditional network filters would only see encrypted packets flowing between two hosts, with no visibility into the actual container endpoints, nor the traffic being sent. Although an encrypted overlay network provides many operational and security benefits, it can also create a security ‘blindness’ scenario in which organizations are unable to effectively monitor traffic within their own networks. Potentially even more critical is the risk of traffic from different apps sharing the same virtual networks. If apps of different sensitivity levels, such as a public-facing web site and an internal treasury management app, are using the same virtual network, sensitive internal apps may be exposed to greater risk from network attack. For example, if the public-facing web site is compromised, attackers may be able to use shared networks to attack the treasury app.",

    "title": "Mixing of workload sensitivity levels",
    "content_description": "Orchestrators are typically focused primarily on driving the scale and density of workloads. This means that, by default, they can place workloads of differing sensitivity levels on the same host. For example, in a default configuration, an orchestrator may place a container running a public- facing web server on the same host as one processing sensitive financial data, simply because that host happens to have the most available resources at the time of deployment. In the case of a critical vulnerability in the web server, this can put the container processing sensitive financial data at significantly greater risk of compromise.",
    "content_remediation": "Orchestrators should be configured to isolate deployments to specific sets of hosts by sensitivity levels. The particular approach for implementing this varies depending on the orchestrator in use, but the general model is to define rules that prevent high sensitivity workloads from being placed on the same host as those running lower sensitivity workloads. This can be accomplished through the use of host ‘pinning’ within the orchestrator or even simply by having separate, individually managed clusters for each sensitivity level. While most container runtime environments do an effective job of isolating containers from each other and from the host OS, in some cases it may be an unnecessary risk to run apps of different sensitivity levels together on the same host OS. Segmenting containers by purpose, sensitivity, and threat posture provides additional defense in depth. Concepts such as application tiering and network and host segmentation should be taken into consideration when planning app deployments. For example, suppose a host is running containers for both a financial database and a public-facing blog. While normally the container runtime will effectively isolate these environments from each other, there is also a shared responsibility amongst the DevOps teams for each app to operate them securely and eliminate unnecessary risk. If the blog app were to be compromised by an attacker, there would be far fewer layers of defense to protect the database if the two apps are running on the same host. Thus, a best practice is to group containers together by relative sensitivity and to ensure that a given host kernel only runs containers of a single sensitivity level. This segmentation may be provided by using multiple physical servers, but modern hypervisors also provide strong enough isolation to effectively mitigate these risks. From the previous example, this may mean that the organization has two sensitivity levels for their containers. One is for financial apps and the database is included in that group. The other is for web apps and the blog is included in that group. The organization would then have two pools of VMs that would each host containers of a single severity level. For example, the host called vm-financial may host the containers running the financial database as well as the tax reporting software, while a host called vm-web may host the blog and the public website. By segmenting containers in this manner, it will be much more difficult for an attacker who compromises one of the segments to expand that compromise to other segments. An attacker who compromises a single server would have limited capabilities to perform reconnaissance and attacks on other containers of a similar sensitivity level and not have any additional access beyond it. This approach also ensures that any residual data, such as caches or local volumes mounted for temp files, stays within the data’s security zone. From the previous example, this zoning would ensure that any financial data cached locally and residually after container termination would never be available on a host running an app at a lower sensitivity level. In larger-scale environments with hundreds of hosts and thousands of containers, this segmentation must be automated to be practical to operationalize. Fortunately, common orchestration platforms typically include some notion of being able to group apps together, and",

Organizations should ensure that orchestration platforms are designed specifically to be resilient to compromise of individual nodes without compromising the overall security of the cluster. A compromised node must be able to be isolated and removed from the cluster without disrupting or degrading overall cluster operations. Finally, organizations should choose orchestrators that provide mutually authenticated network connections between cluster members and end-to-end encryption of intra- cluster traffic.

If a container is compromised and acting maliciously, allowing this network traffic may expose other resources in the environment to risk. For example, a compromised container may be used to scan the network it is connected to in order to find other weaknesses for an attacker to exploit. This risk is related to that from poorly separated virtual networks, as discussed in Section 3.3.3, but different because it is focused more on flows from containers to any outbound destination, not on app “cross talk” scenarios. Egress network access is more complex to manage in a containerized environment because so much of the connection is virtualized between containers. Thus, traffic from one container to another may appear simply as encapsulated packets on the network without directly indicating the ultimate source, destination, or payload. Tools and operational processes that are not container aware are not able to inspect this traffic or determine whether it represents a threat.",

At minimum, these controls should be in place at network borders, ensuring containers are not able to send traffic across networks of differing sensitivity levels, such as from an environment hosting secure data to the internet, similar to the patterns used for traditional architectures. However, the virtualized networking model of inter-container traffic poses an additional challenge. Because containers deployed across multiple hosts typically communicate over a virtual, encrypted network, traditional network devices are often blind to this traffic. Additionally, containers are typically assigned dynamic IP addresses automatically when deployed by orchestrators, and these addresses change continuously as the app is scaled and load balanced. Thus, ideally, organizations should use a combination of existing network level devices and more app-aware network filtering.

For example, on Linux container hosts, the set of allowed system calls is often limited by default to only those required for safe operation of containers. If this list is widened, it may expose containers and the host OS to increased risk from a compromised container. Similarly, if a container is run in privileged mode, it has access to all the devices on the host, thus allowing it to essentially act as part of the host OS and impact all other containers running on it. Another example of an insecure runtime configuration is allowing containers to mount sensitive directories on the host. Containers should rarely make changes to the host OS file system and should almost never make changes to locations that control the basic functionality of the host OS (e.g., /boot or /etc for Linux containers, C:\\Windows for Windows containers). If a compromised container is allowed to make changes to these paths, it could be used to elevate privileges and attack the host itself as well as other containers running on the host.",
    "content_remediation": "Organizations should automate compliance with container runtime configuration standards. Documented technical implementation guidance, such as the Center for Internet Security Docker Benchmark [20], provides details on options and recommended settings, but operationalizing this guidance depends on automation. Organizations can use a variety of tools to “scan” and assess their compliance at a point in time, but such approaches do not scale. Instead, organizations should use tools or processes that continuously assess configuration settings across the environment and actively enforce them. Additionally, mandatory access control (MAC) technologies like SELinux [21] and AppArmor [22] provide enhanced control and isolation for containers running Linux OSs. For example, these technologies can be used to provide additional segmentation and assurance that containers should only be able to access specific file paths, processes, and network sockets, further constraining the ability of even a compromised container to impact the host or other containers. MAC technologies provide protection at the host OS layer, ensuring that only specific files, paths, and processes are accessible to containerized apps. Organizations are encouraged to use the MAC technologies provided by their host OSs in all container deployments. Secure computing (seccomp)7 profiles are another mechanism that can be used to constrain the system-level capabilities containers are allocated at runtime. Common container runtimes like Docker include default seccomp profiles that drop system calls that are unsafe and typically unnecessary for container operation. Additionally, custom profiles can be created and passed to container runtimes to further limit their capabilities.

Organizations that cannot use a container-specific OS should follow the guidance in NIST SP 800-123, Guide to General Server Security [23] to reduce the attack surface of their hosts as much as possible. For example, hosts that run containers should only run containers and not run other apps, like a web server or database, outside of containers. The host OS should not run unnecessary system services, such as a print spooler, that increase its attack and patching surface areas. Finally, hosts should be continuously scanned for vulnerabilities and updates applied",

    "content_description": "Container-specific OSs have a much smaller attack surface than that of general-purpose OSs. For example, they do not contain libraries and package managers that enable a general-purpose OS to directly run database and web server apps. However, although containers provide strong software-level isolation of resources, the use of a shared kernel invariably results in a larger inter-object attack surface than seen with hypervisors, even for container-specific OSs. In other words, the level of isolation provided by container runtimes is not as high as that provided by hypervisors.",
    "content_remediation": "In addition to grouping container workloads onto hosts by sensitivity level, organizations should not mix containerized and non-containerized workloads on the same host instance. For example, if a host is running a web server container, it should not also run a web server (or any other app) as a regularly installed component directly within the host OS. Keeping containerized workloads isolated to container-specific hosts makes it simpler and safer to apply countermeasures and defenses that are optimized for protecting containers.",

    "content_description": "All host OSs, even container-specific ones, provide foundational system components—for example, the cryptographic libraries used to authenticate remote connections and the kernel primitives used for general process invocation and management. Like any other software, these components can have vulnerabilities and, because they exist low in the container technology architecture, they can impact all the containers and apps that run on these hosts.",
    "content_remediation": "Organizations should implement management practices and tools to validate the versioning of components provided for base OS management and functionality. Even though container- specific OSs have a much more minimal set of components than general-purpose OSs, they still do have vulnerabilities and still require remediation. Organizations should use tools provided by the OS vendor or other trusted organizations to regularly check for and apply updates to all software components used within the OS. The OS should be kept up to date not only with security updates, but also the latest component updates recommended by the vendor. This is particularly important for the kernel and container runtime components as newer releases of these components often add additional security protections and capabilities beyond simply correcting vulnerabilities. Some organizations may choose to simply redeploy new OS instances with the necessary updates, rather than updating existing systems. This approach is also valid, although it often requires more sophisticated operational practices. Host OSs should be operated in an immutable manner with no data or state stored uniquely and persistently on the host and no application-level dependencies provided by the host. Instead, all app components and dependencies should be packaged and deployed in containers. This enables the host to be operated in a nearly stateless manner with a greatly reduced attack surface. Additionally, it provides a more trustworthy way to identify anomalies and configuration drift.",

Once compromised, the attacker may be able to map other systems in the environment, attempt to elevate privileges within the compromised container, or abuse the container for use in attacks on other systems (such as acting as a file dropper or command and control endpoint). Organizations that adopt the recommended countermeasures would have multiple layers of defense in depth against such threats: 1. Detecting the vulnerable image early in the deployment process and having controls in place to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed would prevent the vulnerability from being introduced into production. 2. Container-aware network monitoring and filtering would detect anomalous connections to other containers during the attempt to map other systems. 3. Container-aware process monitoring and malware detection would detect the running of invalid or unexpected malicious processes and the data they introduce into the environment.",

The usage of mandatory access control capabilities can provide additional barriers to ensure that process and file system activity is still segmented within the defined boundaries. 2. Segmentation of workloads ensures that the scope of the compromise would be limited to apps of a common sensitivity level that are sharing the host. For example, a compromised runtime on a host only running web apps would not impact runtimes on other hosts running containers for financial apps. 3.

Automatically scanning images for vulnerabilities and malware, which may detect malicious code such as rootkits embedded within an image. 4. Implementing runtime controls that limit the container's ability to abuse resources, escalate privileges, and run executables. 5. Using container-level network segmentation to limit the “blast radius” of what the poisoned image might do. 6. Validating a container runtime operates following least-privilege and least-access principles. 7. Building a threat profile of the container's runtime.

A non-exhaustive list of them can be found in the publication Compendium of risk-managements frameworks with potential interoperability, - willingness to invest a certain percentage of revenue in measures (e.g. 5% of annual revenue); - adherence to regulatory obligations with specific penalties or fines influencing risk acceptance; - acceptable level of customer dissatisfaction or negative media exposure from a data breach (e.g. tolerating one major incident every few years); - acceptance of certain vulnerabilities based on risk mitigation measures in place (e.g. outdated software provided that it is monitored and patched regularly); - time frame for responding to and recovering from incidents (e.g. a maximum of 48 hours for containment); and - acceptance of minor incidents as part of normal operations while prioritizing major threats. - Define risk acceptance criteria, which may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): - accepting risks categorized as low severity, such as minor data leaks that don't expose sensitive information; - accepting risks assessed as having a low likelihood of occurrence (e.g. certain rare types of cyberattacks); - accepting risks if the cost of mitigation exceeds the potential impact (e.g. not upgrading legacy systems if the upgrade cost is significantly higher than potential losses); - accepting specific compliance risks if there is a plan in place to address them within a defined timeframe (e.g. temporarily accepting minor non-compliance with a commitment to remediate within six months); - allowing certain risks in low-criticality systems or departments that do not affect core business - perations (e.g. accepting a risk in a test environment); - accepting certain vulnerabilities for a defined period while planning for remediation (e.g. accepting the risk of outdated software for three months until a full upgrade can be completed); - accepting risks where the expected incident impact falls below a predetermined financial threshold (e.g. losses under EUR 50,000 accepted without further action); - accepting risks after informing stakeholders and receiving their agreement, particularly if they understand the trade-offs involved; and - accepting residual risks where existing measures reduce the likelihood or impact to an acceptable level (e.g. using encryption for sensitive data but accepting risks of loss due to user error). - Define risk criteria, that is, how the entity evaluates the significance of the risks that it identifies and makes decisions concerning risks. Risk criteria may include (indicative, non-exhaustive list): - alignment with risk appetite: accepting risks that align with the organization's overall risk appetite, such as delays in internal reporting processes that do not impact customer service or compliance; - regulatory and legal exposure: prioritizing risks based on potential legal or regulatory consequences, such as treating violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) involving customer data as high-risk due to potential fines and reputational damage; - reputational impact: escalating risks that could significantly harm the organization's public image, such as incidents likely to attract media attention; - risk velocity: giving higher priority to risks with high velocity, such as zero-day exploits that can be weaponised before patches are available; More information on risk criteria can be found in ISO/IEC 27005:2022, paragraph 6.4. It is important to understand that risk appetite, defined as the amount of risk an entity is willing to pursue or accept, can vary considerably from entity to entity. For instance, factors affecting an entity’s risk appetite include size, complexity and sector. - recovery complexity: treating risks as critical if they involve complex or time-consuming recovery, such as cyber-attacks on legacy systems with limited vendor support; - emerging technology risks: Considering risks involving emerging technologies as higher priority, such as AI systems producing unexplainable or non-compliant decisions due to lack of transparency; - stakeholder sensitivity: re-evaluating risks that concern key stakeholders, such as risks flagged by the board, regulators or major customers, even if the assessed technical risk is low. - Criteria for performing cybersecurity risk assessments refer to consequences, likelihood or level of risk. These may refer to (indicative, non-exhaustive list): - the importance of assets; - the severity of threats; - the vulnerability of network and information systems; - impact analysis; - existing measures; and - stakeholders concerns or requirements. - Make a list of the main risks for the security of network and information systems, taking into account the main threats to the assets in scope. - Make sure that each risk is associated with at least one: - - f the risk treatment options or a combination of them, in line with the results of the risk assessment and in accordance with the entity’s policy on the security of network and information systems (recital 11 of the regulation); and - specific risk treatment measure. - Develop risk-treatment plans to address the elements in points (i) and (j) in point 2.1.2 of the Annex to the regulation. - Assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals or teams for executing these risk treatment plans.",

Typically, they are measured in maximum time needed to recover data without causing unacceptable, according to the risk assessment, damage to the entity’s activities, for example maximum recovery time for an e-commerce website, an ERP system or an email server. - Service delivery objective (SDO) to determine the minimum level of performance that needs to be reached by business functions during the alternate processing mode. An indicative and nonexhaustive list of examples includes:  the percentage of inbound calls to be answered by a call centre within a specific timeframe;  the level of availability of ordering and payment systems of an e-commerce website within a specific timeframe;  the restoration time for accessing essential shared folders via a cloud file access system; and  the timeframe within which the full functionality of the remote work infrastructure is restored. - Maximum acceptable outage (MAO) or maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD) to determine the time it would take for the potential impacts of not providing a product/service or performing an activity to become unacceptable or significant, in accordance with the risk assessment. Typically they are longer than RTOs. MAOs focus on service availability while RPOs focus on data loss. An indicative and non-exhaustive list of examples:  the period of time beyond which the customer service would be severely impacted and reputation risk increases quickly;  the longest period of time that extended outage of an e-commerce website might result to major loss of sales and customer trust;  the longest period of time that shared access to project files may halt collaboration or decision-making in case that data is stored in cloud; and  the maximum acceptable outage for remote work infrastructure beyond which business functions are significantly impaired and productivity losses begin to escalate. - RTOs, RPOs and SDOs may be used to determine backup and redundancy procedures. Consider the following standards: ISO/TS 22317:2021 and NIST special publication 800-34. For definitions of terms, refer to ISO 22300:2021. - Document disaster recovery plan, taking into account: - the RTOs, RPOs and SDOs; and - compliance with applicable regulations and legislation.",

It is ideal for large and distributed environments. - Feature toggles allow new features or patches to be deployed to production but keep them disabled until they are ready to be used. They are suitable for control over new features or patches when they are turned on, making it easy to test and release. - Shadow deployment allows new code or patches to be deployed directly to production but it shadows live traffic by mirroring user requests to both the current and new systems to observe how the new version behaves without affecting the user experience. It is ideal for testing new features in production without affecting users. - Hotfix deployments are used for critical patches that need to be applied immediately to address severe issues. - Where appropriate and to reduce risks related to significant updates in important dependencies, consider performing a trial using release candidates ( 60) of these components, to get an early indication of incompatibilities or breaking changes, so they may be remedied.

Below is a list of currently available solutions ordered from strongest to weakest. - ‘Strong’:  phishing-resistant: - no shared secrets, not vulnerable to attacker-in-the-middle; - protected cryptographic private key that can be securely registered to: - a domain, in accordance with Fast Identity Online (FIDO) and W3C WebAuthn standards; Password complexity can be a good cybersecurity practice, but it is not the only factor to consider. Recent guidelines, such as those from NIST, emphasise password length over complexity; see line 725. - a trust provider, following public key infrastructure and International Telecommunication Union X.509 standards. - ‘Medium’ MFA, for example:  push notification, number matching or application based. - ‘Last resort’ MFA, for example:  text message or email OTP. - Perform password encryption and hashing in accordance with approved cryptographic techniques for passwords (section 9.2). - Generate an alert when a potential attempted or successful breach of login controls is detected.",

Parameters to consider are (indicative, non-exhaustive list): - purpose and scope; - network and information systems in scope; - description of facilities; - roles and responsibilities; - management commitment; - coordination among organisational units; - compliance with national and EU law, including personal data protection. Where a company operates with a fully remote workforce and lacks centralized on-premises infrastructure, traditional physical and environmental threat protections at a single location may be less critical. The distributed nature of remote work inherently provides resilience by diversifying exposure to localized physical and environmental risks. Consequently organizations should focus on ensuring that remote employees’ home work environments meet minimum security and safety standards and consider leveraging cloud service providers’ robust physical security controls. This distributed operational model reduces dependency on any single physical site, thereby mitigating the impact of localized environmental or physical incidents. - Consider potential physical and environmental threats relevant to the context, location and operational environment. The following list offers examples (indicative and non-exhaustive) to support risk-based planning: - fire, flood or natural events (e.g. earthquakes, storms), - public disturbances or unauthorized access, theft or vandalism, - hazardous material incidents (e.g. chemical spills), - long-term environmental changes (e.g. climate trends, air quality). - Consider measures against physical and environmental threats such as (indicative, non-exhaustive list): - physical access control measures (e.g. IDs, badges, logs; visitor management system and physical barriers); - surveillance systems (e.g. CCTV, entry points, exits, locking mechanisms and security personnel); - climate control (e.g. temperature and humidity controls and HVAC systems); - fire prevention and response measures (e.g. fire alarms, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers); - Consider enhanced (maximum) measures to be activated during heightened threat levels or specific scenarios.

    "content_remediation": "- In the risk assessment, consider risks associated with unauthorised physical access to, damage to and interference with network and information systems. In a fully remote operating model where the organization does not maintain centralized office spaces or on-premises infrastructure, traditional perimeter and physical access control measures (e.g. badge systems, mantraps, on-site security personnel) may not be applicable. Instead, the focus should shift to ensuring that access to corporate resources is governed through strong logical access controls, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), endpoint compliance checks and secure connectivity (e.g. VPN or Zero Trust Network Access). For personnel working from home organizations should provide on securing home workspaces—such as restricting unauthorized physical access to work devices and using locked rooms or cabinets when necessary. Where third-party cloud or co-location facilities are used, physical access controls should be reviewed and enforced contractually through SLAs and verified via audit reports (e.g. ISO 27001, SOC 2). - Based on the results of the risk assessment, determine high-criticality assets and the impact of their being compromised. This will help in identifying the perimeter for such assets. - Prevent unauthorised physical access to facilities and set up adequate measures. - Physical access control measures designed to protect the entity as a whole will also protect individual assets. - Consider introducing further specific access control measures for specific assets or facilities. - Consider physical security measures (indicative, non-exhaustive list): - physical access controls such as key cards, biometric scanners, locks and security personnel to restrict access to high-criticality areas, - electronic control of entry, with an audit trail, - segmentation of spaces or creation of zones according to authorization levels and their contents, - CCTV cameras and monitoring systems to continuously observe sensitive areas, - fencing, barriers and security patrols for securing physical perimeters, - guards and/or alarms to monitor every physical access point to the facility where the information system resides, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. - Develop and enforce procedures for granting, reviewing and revoking physical access rights (section 11.2). - Identify a designated official within the entity to review and approve the list of personnel with authorized physical access. - Maintain a list of personnel with authorized access to facilities, and their authorization levels.",
